Hand distance detection based on landmarks of palm detected through computer camera. 

Hand distance detection using OpenCV in Python involves using computer vision techniques to identify the position and distance of a hand in an image or video. The process involves several steps, including capturing and preprocessing the image, applying filters to isolate the hand region, detecting and segmenting the hand from the background, and calculating the distance between the hand and the camera.

Overall, hand distance detection using OpenCV in Python is a useful technique for applications that require gesture recognition, virtual reality, or human-computer interaction.
